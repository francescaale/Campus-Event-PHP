# Campus-Event-PHP

This is a web-based platform designed to showcase and promote campus events. The site allows students and staff to explore upcoming events, view event details, and engage with the campus community.

Features

- Interactive event listings with dates and descriptions  
- Location and time details for each event  
- Visually engaging layout with student-friendly design  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices  
- Easy navigation between homepage, event pages, and contact sections

 Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Layout
- **Backend**: PHP (for user authentication and event management)
- **Database**: MySQL (stores user details, event information, and admin-created events)

How It Works

- **User Registration**: New users can sign up and log in with standard user roles. Admins have extra privileges to manage events.
- **Admin Access**: Admins can create new events through a custom form, which gets stored in the database and automatically populates the event list.
- **Event Details**: Each event has its own page with a dynamic URL for easy access and sharing.
- **User Roles**: Regular users can view events, while admins can add, update, or delete events.
